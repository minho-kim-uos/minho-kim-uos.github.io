				Please DO NOT include any library files,

			Goal: To implement a simple 2D firework app.
			</li>
			<li>
				Requirements
				<ul>
					<li>If the mouse is clicked on the canvas,
					a &ldquo;firework&rdquo;
					pops up at the mouse position and disappears after some time.
					</li>
					<li>
					The firework should
						<ul>
							<li>get bigger,</li>
							<li>rotate,</li>
							<li>change its brightness from bright to dark, and</li>
							<li>disappear after some time.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
					When the mouse is clicked while 
					the firework is still being rendered,
					the previous one disappears immediately
					and the new one pops up.
					</li>
					<li>
					The firework shape should be 
					rendered analytically on a quad. Refer
					to <a href="http://jwilson.coe.uga.edu/EMAT6680Fa08/Radford/Assignment11/Assignment11.html">this page</a>
					or other websites
					to see various analytic shapes.
					You can choose whatever shape you think  interesting.
					</li>
					<li>
						Refer to
						<a href="https://xregy.github.io/webgl/src/point-circle.html">this example</a>
						to see how to render a shape
						analytically on a quad.

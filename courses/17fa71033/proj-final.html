		<h1 align=center>Final Project: &ldquo;Searching Drone&rdquo;</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>
			Objective:
			To implement interactive searching drone.
			</li>
			<li style="color:red;">
			(Due: 21 Dec 11:59pm)
			</li>
			<li>
			Requirements:
				<ul>
					<li>
						Implement a &ldquo;drone&rdquo;
						that can be controlled interactively.
						<ul>
							<li>
							The shape of the drone doesn't matter.
							</li>
							<li>
							A UI (keyboard or mouse)
							to control the drone needs to be implemented.
							The user should be able to control the drone
							freely in the sky.
							The UI spec is as follows.:
								<ul>
									<li>UP: move forward</li>
									<li>DOWN: move backward</li>
									<li>LEFT/RIGHT: rotate around the vertical axis 
									(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_principal_axes">yaw</a>)
									</li>
									<li>w/W: move up</li>
									<li>s/S: move down</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Implement (one or more) &ldquo;search lights&rdquo;
						attached to the drone.
						<ul>
							<li>By default, the search light(s) should be directed to the ground.</li>
							<li>The lights should be modeled as
							<a href="http://www.lighthouse3d.com/tutorials/glsl-tutorial/spotlights">spotlights</a>.</li>
							<li>The direction of the light(s) can be 
							controlled by the user.
							But the multiple lights do not have to be controlled separately.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Implement a camera attached to the drone.
						<ul>
							<li>By default, the camera should be directed to the ground.</li>
							<li>Render the scene viewed from the camera at the corner of the screen.</li>
							<li>To verify the small screen,
							render the viewing frustum of the camera
							using lines only.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
					Make your program as fancy as possible!
					</li>
				</ul>

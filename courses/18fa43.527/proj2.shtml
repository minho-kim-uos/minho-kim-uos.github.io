				Requirements
				<ul>
					<li>
						Draw a cube with edge lengths 2 and with its center at the origin
                        of the world space.
						The faces of the cube should be colored differently.
					</li>
					<li>
						Draw two tracks as circles 
                        with their radii (&rho; in [Figure]) 10.
                        <ul>
                            <li>One track (white circle in the video)
                            denotes the &ldquo;equator&rdquo;
                                and the camera moves along the equator
                                as its longitude changes.
								(&theta; in [Figure])
							</li>
                            <li>The other track (yellow circle in the video)
                            denotes the path 
                            along which the camera moves as its latitude
                            changes.
                                (&delta; in [Figure])
                                Note that this track should be transformed
                                as the longitude changes.
                                </li>
                                
                        </ul>
					</li>
                    <li>
                        To show the camera location (P in [Figure]),
                        draw the &ldquo;line of sight&rdquo;
                        (the pink line in the video.)
                        from the camera position to the origin.
						The distance to the camera from the origin should be 10.
                    </li>
					<li>
						On the left half of the canvas,
						draw the whole scene (the cube, the camera tracks, and the line-of-sight)
						seen from the fixed camera.
						(You do not need to draw the axes.)
						<ul>
							<li>The camera can be either orthographic or perspective.</li>
							<li>Just make it sure that the whole seen can be seen.</li>
							<li>You can use <tt>setLookAt()</tt>/<tt>lookAt()</tt> for this viewing transformation.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						On the right half of the canvas,
						draw the scene viewed from the moving camera.
						<ul>
							<li>You should use a perspective camera.</li>
							<li>Set the parameters properly so that 
							the whole cube can be drawn. </li>
							<li>The distance from the camera to the origin should be 10.</li>
							<li>When longitude=latitude=0, the camera should be (in world coordinates)
								<ul>
									<li>located at (0, 0, 10)</li>
									<li>looking long the direction (0,0,-1)</li>
									<li>with it &ldquo;up direction&rdquo; (0,1,0).</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
						You should NOT use <tt>setLootAt()</tt>/<tt>lookAt</tt> function for thie viewing transformation.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						The moving camera should
						be controlled by the arrow keys
						and the slide bars.
                        (The range of the longitude is [0,360]
                        and that of the latitude is [-90,90].)
                        <ul>
                            <li>Left/Right: Decrese/increse the longitude by 1 degree.</li>
                            <li>Down/Up: Decrese/increse the latitude by 1 degree.</li>
                        </ul>
						When the camera is moved by the arrow keys,
						the slide bars should be changed accordingly.
					</li>
				</ul>

				Instructions
				<ul>
					<li>
						Submit two files only. The file names should be
						<ul>
							<li><tt>proj2.html</tt></li>
							<li><tt>proj2.js</tt> 
							(To avoid being rejected by the mail server,
							 please change the name of this file to <tt>proj2.txt</tt>.)</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Do submit any compressed file. Just attach the files as they are.
					</li>
					<li>
					You should submit a <tt>README</tt> file
						about your implemntation.
						(What you successfully implemented,
						what you failed to implement, etc.)
					</li>

					<li>
					You should use the following four libraries ONLY 
						and include them as below.
						<div style="border:black 1px solid;">

				Mistake during the lecture on 10 Nov.
				When explaining the derivation of the error estimation
				of the composite trapezoidal method,
				I said that the &xi;<sub>i</sub>
				in the step 2 is different from 
				the &xi;<sub>i</sub> in the step 1, but I was wrong.
				They are the same.
				You can obtain the equation in step 2 from the equation in step 1
				by substituting x by x<sub>i</sub>.

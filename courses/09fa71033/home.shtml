					<tt>viewer.c</tt> is updated.
					In the old version, only positive ids are used

					<span class=date>11/6</span>
					More mistakes.
					I wrote all the samples using freeglut
					as the glut library.
					You may have a compilation error
					if you try compiling them with
					GLUT32.
					To fix it, just put the line
					"<tt>#include &lt;GL/glut.h&gt;</tt>"
					below all the other header files.
					(e.g., <tt>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</tt>)
					<p>
					Also, some sample programs doesn't show
					anything since I mistakenly call
					<tt>glutSwapBuffers</tt>
					while I just initialized single buffer.
					(<tt>polyoffset.c</tt> and <tt>hud.c</tt>
					had this bug.)
					Now I fixed them. (at leat I believe so...)
					Let me know if you have any problem with
					the samples.
				</li>

					<span class=date>11/6</span>
					There was an error in the executable
					<a href="proj2/proj2_xp32.exe"><tt>proj2_xp32.exe</tt></a>.
					(I compiled using "freeglut"
					not "GLUT for Win32" by mistake.)
					Please let me know if you still have any problem.

					<span class=date>9/17</span>
					GLUT sample codes are uploaded in the <a href="materials.shtml">materials</a> page.
					<p>
					You may notice that a sample named <a href="data/postredisplay.c"><tt>postredisplay.c</tt></a> is posted which was not presented in the lecture today.
					This sample is to show you how to use the function 
				<a href="http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/spec3/node20.html#SECTION00055000000000000000"><tt>glutPostRedisplay</tt></a>.
					When you press the space bar, the color of the rectangle will be switched between red and white.
					We expect the color changes immediately after we press the space bar, 
					and this is why we call the function at the end of <tt>keyboard</tt> callback.
					Without this, the color changes only when the window needs to be refreshed. 
					(so that the <tt>display</tt> callback is called)
					To see the effect, try commenting out the line calling <tt>glutPostRedisplay</tt>
					and see how it works.
					Without the call, you have to force the <tt>display</tt> callback
					is called by, for example, covering the window with another window
					and then removing it away.

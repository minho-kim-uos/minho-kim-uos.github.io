		Requirements
		<ul>
			<li>
				Render the scene in two different viewports
				as in the Figure 1.
				<ul>
					<li>In the left viewport,
					the (perspective) camera should be 
					located such that 
					the whole scene 
					is viewed as in the figure.
					</li>
					<li>
						You do NOT need
						to render
						the view frustum 
						as in the Figure 1.
					</li>
					<li>
						In the right viewport,
						the scene viewed from
						the (perspective) camera
						attached on the bottom
						of the chopper should be rendered.
						The scene should 
						change
						according to the chopper movement.
					</li>
					<li>
						For multiple viewports,
						refer to 
						<a href="https://xregy.github.io/webgl/src/multiple_viewports.html">this example</a>.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Render the landscape.
				<ul>
					Draw a quad-shaped landscape with its size
					2x2 on the x-y plane
					with its center
					at the origin of the 
					&ldquo;world coordinates system&rdquo;.
					(The &ldquo;up&rdquo; direction
					is the z-axis.)
					See
					Figure 2.

				</ul>
				<ul>
						Make the quad
						texture-mapped
						with an image you chose.
						(Be careful with the license.)
				</ul>
				<ul>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Render a chopper.
				<ul>
					<li>The body and the rotor should be rendered as 3D mesh.
						<ul>
							<li>You have to use vertex attributes for the color.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>The rotor should keep rotating as project #1.</li>
					<li>Make the chopper look as fancy as you want.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Implement a keyboard controller.
				<ul>
					<li>Up: Move forward by 0.05</li>
					<li>Down: Move backward by 0.05</li>
					<li>Left: Rotate counterclockwise by 10 degree</li>
					<li>Right: Rotate clockwise by 10 degree</li>
					<li>W/w: Move upward in the air by 0.05</li>
					<li>S/s: Move downward in the air by 0.05</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Note
				<ul>
					<li>If you failed to implement the project #1,
						you can start with the source code I sent,
						but with 10 points penalty.
						Ask me to send the code if you want.
					</li>
					<li>
						Send me the zip file (html + js)
						as an attachment.
					</li>
				</ul>

1. Install Visual Studio c++ Express 
2. Install GLUT library
	1) Download pre-compiled GLUT for Win32 (glut-3.7.6-bin.zip)
		(You can download and compile freeglut if you want, but it's more complicated.)
	2) Extracts GLUT in a folder, e.g., "C:\lib\".
		(Now all files (glut32.dll, glut32.lib, glut.h) are located in C:\lib\glut-3.7.6-bin)
	3) Creates folder "GL" in "C:\lib\glut-3.7.6-bin" and move "glut.h" in "GL".
3. Set environment variables.
	1) Go to "제어판->시스템->고급->환경변수->시스템 변수->새로 만들기
	2) Create a environment variable with 변수 이름: GLUTROOT, 변수 값: C:\lib\glut-3.7.6-bin
	3) Go to "제어판->시스템->고급->환경변수->시스템 변수->select "Path"->편집
	4) Add ";%GLUTROOT%" at the end.
4. Set environment for the Visual Studio
	1) Tools->Options->Project and Solutions->VC++ Directories
	2) Platforms: Win32, Show directories for: Include files
	3) Add "$(GLUTROOT)" in the list.
	4) Platforms: Win32, Show directories for: Include files
	5) Add "$(GLUTROOT)" in the list.
5. Create and execute an OpenGL sample
	1) File->New->Project...
	2) Project type: General, Templates: Empty project,
		name: hello, location: [wherever you want], uncheck "Create Directory for Solution"
	3) Download hello.c and place it in the folder where the project file is.
	4) In the "solution explorer", right-click "Source files"->Add->Existing Item...
	5) Select hello.c
	6) Build->Build solution
	7) "Debug"->"Start debugging"

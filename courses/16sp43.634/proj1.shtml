			<ul>
				<li>

				is provided.

				<li>
				You need to draw a cubic B&eacute;zier
				curve defined by the four control points.
				</li>
				<li>
				You can draw a curve by 
				approximating it with
				a piecewise linear curve
				defined by uniform samples on the curve
				(e.g., for t=0, 0.01, 0.02, ..., 0.99, 1.0).
				</li>
				<li>
				You need to implement two versions for curve evaluation.
				One using the <b>de Casteljau algorithm</b>
				and the other using
				the <b>Bernstein basis functions</b>.
				</li>
				<li>
				When the control polygon is modified
				interactively,
				the curve also needs to be updated accordingly.

Compiling OpenGL program with Visual Studio 2008

1. Build GLUT libraries.
	1-1. Download the lastest "stable release" version at the freeglut project page. (http://freeglut.sourceforge.net)
	1-2. Extract the downloaded file.
	1-3. Compile static libraries
		1-3-1. Open freeglut-*/VisualStudio2008Static/freeglut.sln.
		1-3-2. With the configuration as "Debug", build freeglut project only.
		1-3-3. Do the same with "Release" configuration.
		1-3-4. Now you have freeglut_static.lib in both Debug and Release folders.
	1.4. Compile dynamic libraries
		1-4-1. Open freeglut-*/VisualStudio2008/freeglut.sln.
		1-4-2. Build freeglut project for both Debug and Release configurations.
		1-4-3. Now you have freeglut.lib and freeglut.dll in both Debug and Release folders.

* To make a self-contained directory structure, I recommend you to organize files as follows:
	mystuff/include/GL: glut.h, freeglut.h, freeglut_std.h, freeglut_ext.h
	mystuff/lib/Debug: freeglut.lib, freeglut_static.lib (Debug versions)
	mystuff/lib/Release: freeglut.lib, freeglut_static.lib (Release versions)
	mystuff/proj: all your projects

2. Create a project
	2-1. File - New - Project...
	2-2. Select Visual C++ - General - Empty Project for template.
	2-3. "sample01" for "Name" field
	2-4. "mystuff/proj" for "Location" field
	2-5. Click OK
	2-6. A folder "sample01" is created in mystuff/proj with necessary files in it.
	2-7. Copy sample01.c in sample01 folder.
	2-8. Add sample01.c into the project "Source Files"

3. Set up include search path
	3-1. Highlight "sample01" project in "Solution Explorer" pane on the left.
	3-2. Project - Properties
	3-3. Choose Configuration Properties - C/C++ - General
	3-4. Add "../../include" in "Additional Include Directories."
	3-5. Do this for both "Debut" and "Release" configurations on top.

4. Set up library search path
	* For static link (Large exe size, but no freeglut.dll is required for running.)
	4-1. Highlight "sample01" project in "Solution Explorer" pane on the left.
	4-2. Project - Properties
	4-3. Choose Configuration Properties - C/C++ - Preprocessor
	4-4. Add "FREEGLUT_STATIC" in "Preprocessor Definitions" for both configurations.
	4-5. Choose Configuration Properties - Link - General
	4-6. Choose "Debug" in "Configuration" on top and add "../../lib/Debug" in "Additional Library Directories".
	4-7. Choose "Release" in "Configuration" on top and add "../../lib/Release" in "Additional Library Directories".
	4-8. Choose Configuration Properties - Link - Input
	4-9. Add "freeglut_static.lib" in "Additional Dependencies" for both configurations.

	* For dynamic link (Small exe size, but freeglut.dll is required to be in PATH for running.)
	4-1. Highlight "sample01" project in "Solution Explorer" pane on the left.
	4-2. Project - Properties
	4-3. Choose Configuration Properties - Link - General
	4-4. Choose "Debug" in "Configuration" on top and add "../../lib/Debug" in "Additional Library Directories".
	4-5. Choose "Release" in "Configuration" on top and add "../../lib/Release" in "Additional Library Directories".
	4-6. Choose Configuration Properties - Link - Input
	4-7. Add "freeglut.lib" in "Additional Dependencies" for both configurations.

5. Build sample01 project and execute it.

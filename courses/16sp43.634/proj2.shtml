			<ul>
				<li>

				<li>
				You need to draw two separate cubic B-spline
				curves each defined by the following knot sequences.
					<ul>
						<li>0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7</li>
						<li>-3,-3,-1,1,1,2,4,4,4,6,7,10</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
				Figure out yourself the number of curve segments for each case.
				</li>
				<li>
				Draw each curve segment in different color so that they can be easily 
				distinguished.
				</li>
				<li>
				When the control polygon is modified
				interactively,
				the curve also needs to be updated accordingly.
